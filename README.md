# bamazon
node and mySQL homework project


<h1>Description:</h1>

This node/mySQL application prints a table of products from a fictional server called "Bamazon". A user will enter the item id # of their choosing, how many of that item they would like to purchase, and the table will then be updated with the remaining inventory. 

This app utilizes the **command line, Javascript, node packages/modules, and mySQL** to display and perform these transactions.
